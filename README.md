**## Task 1 ( C Programming )**
1. Hello Gru
A C/C++ program that prints the string ‘GRU’ in the output terminal.
3. Counting Down
A C/C++ program that takes the number to start the countdown from as input and prints the countdown text starting from that number.
5. Task Manager
A C/C++ program that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks, each task has an id/index and a description. The id is a positive unique integer.
7. Kalman Missile
A C/C++ program that takes two sensor measurements (just two arrays) and generates only one new array measurement with any averaging method, such as Kalman Filter.
• The two sensors have two different accuracies one has 79% and another one has 92%, (You should consider this information in your output formula).
• IMU sensor outputs the forces in all spatial coordinates x, y, z, but for the sake of simplicity we only work in one dimension which is y.
• Assume two sensors have the same sample frequency, (that means the two arrays have the same number of elements)
